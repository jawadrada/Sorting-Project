# Sorting-Project

## **Overview**
This project conducts a comparative analysis of six sorting algorithms: Insertion, Bubble, Selection, Merge, Quick, and HeapSort. Each algorithm is tested under identical conditions to ensure a fair comparison. The primary metrics for comparison are:

- **Time Efficiency**: Measuring the time each algorithm takes to complete the sorting process.
- **Step Count**: Counting the total number of steps (or operations) taken by each algorithm to sort an array.

The sorting algorithms are evaluated using three types of input arrays:

- **Inorder Arrays**: Arrays where elements are already sorted in ascending order.
- **Reverse Arrays**: Arrays sorted in descending order, requiring complete reordering.
- **Random Permutation Arrays**: Arrays with elements in a completely random order.

Additionally, the project includes an implementation of a hybrid sorting technique that combines Merge Sort and Insertion Sort, exploring its efficiency compared to the traditional methods.

### **Technolgy Required**
This project requires the c++ programming language. Additionally, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) capable of compiling and running c++ code is needed.
